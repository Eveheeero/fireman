# MASKMOVDQU

Store Selected Bytes of Double Quadword

Stores selected bytes from the source operand (first operand) into an 128-bit memory location.
The mask operand (second operand) selects which bytes from the source operand are written to memory.
The source and mask oper-ands are XMM registers.
The memory location specified by the effective address in the DI/EDI/RDI register (the default segment register is DS, but this may be overridden with a segment-override prefix).
The memory location does not need to be aligned on a natural boundary.
(The size of the store address depends on the address-size attribute.)The most significant bit in each byte of the mask operand determines whether the corresponding byte in the source operand is written to the corresponding byte location in memory: 0 indicates no write and 1 indicates write.
The MASKMOVDQU instruction generates a non-temporal hint to the processor to minimize cache pollution.
The non-temporal hint is implemented by using a write combining (WC) memory type protocol (see "Caching of Â® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Temporal vs.
Non-Temporal Data" in Chapter 10, of the IntelManual, Volume 1).
Because the WC protocol uses a weakly-ordered memory consistency model, a fencing opera-tion implemented with the SFENCE or MFENCE instruction should be used in conjunction with MASKMOVDQU instructions if multiple processors might use different memory types to read/write the destination memory loca-tions.Behavior with a mask of all 0s is as follows: - No data will be written to memory.
 - Signaling of breakpoints (code or data) is not guaranteed; different processor implementations may signal or not signal these breakpoints.
- Exceptions associated with addressing memory and page faults may still be signaled (implementation dependent).
- If the destination memory region is mapped as UC or WP, enforcement of associated semantics for these memory types is not guaranteed (that is, is reserved) and is implementation-specific.
The MASKMOVDQU instruction can be used to improve performance of algorithms that need to merge data on a byte-by-byte basis.
MASKMOVDQU should not cause a read for ownership; doing so generates unnecessary band-width since data is to be written directly using the byte-mask without allocating old data prior to the store.
In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).Note: In VEX-encoded versions, VEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.If VMASKMOVDQU is encoded with VEX.L= 1, an attempt to execute the instruction encoded with VEX.L= 1 will
