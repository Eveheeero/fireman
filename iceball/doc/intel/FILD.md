# FILD

Load Integer

Converts the signed-integer source operand into double extended-precision floating-point format and pushes the value onto the FPU register stack.
The source operand can be a word, doubleword, or quadword integer.
It is loaded without rounding errors.
The sign of the source operand is preserved.This instruction's operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.

## Exceptions

- 64-Bit Mode Exceptions
  - #SS(0) - If a memory address referencing the SS segment is in a non-canonical form.
  - #GP(0) - If the memory address is in a non-canonical form.
  - #NM - CR0.EM[bit 2] or CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.
  - #MF - If there is a pending x87 FPU exception.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled and an
  > unaligned memory reference is made while the 
- Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions
  - #GP(0) - If a memory operand effective address is
  > outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  - #SS(0) - If a memory operand effective ad

  - #NM - CR0.EM[bit 2] or CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled an
- Protected Mode Exceptions
  - #GP(0) - If a memory operand effective address is
  > outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  > If the DS, ES, FS, or GS register contains a NULL segment selector.

  - #NM - CR0.EM[bit 2] or CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled and an
  > unaligned memory reference is made while the 
  > current privilege level is 3.
  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used.
- Floating-Point Exceptions
  - #IS - Stack overflow occurred.
- Compatibility Mode Exceptions
  > Same exceptions as in protected mode.
- Real-Address Mode Exceptions
  - #GP - If a memory operand effective address is ou

  - #SS - If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS segment limit.
  - #NM - CR0.EM[bit 2] or CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.
  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used.
