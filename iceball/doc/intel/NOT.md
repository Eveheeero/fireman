# NOT

One's Complement Negation

Performs a bitwise NOT operation (each 1 is set to 0, and each 0 is set to 1) on the destination operand and stores the result in the destination operand location.
The destination operand can be a register or a memory location.This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits.
Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15).
Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits.
See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.

## Flags affected

- None.

## Exceptions

- Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions
  - #GP(0) - If a memory operand effective address is
  > outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  - #SS(0) - If a memory operand effective a
  > ddress is outside the SS segment limit.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled an
  > d an unaligned memory reference is made.
  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used but th
  > e destination is not a memory operand.
- Compatibility Mode Exceptions
  > Same as for protected mode exceptions.
- Real-Address Mode Exceptions
  - #GP - If a memory operand effective address is ou
  > tside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
- 64-Bit Mode Exceptions
  - #SS(0) - If a memory address referencing the SS segment is in a non-canonical form.
  - #GP(0) - If the memory address is in a non-canonical form.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled and an
  > unaligned memory reference is made while the 
  > current privilege level is 3.
- Protected Mode Exceptions
  - #GP(0) - If the destination operand points to a non-writable segment.
  > If a memory operand effective address is outs
  > ide the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  > If the DS, ES, FS, or GS register contains a NULL segment selector.
  - #SS(0) - If a memory operand effective ad
  > dress is outside the SS segment limit.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled and an
  > unaligned memory reference is made while the 
  > current privilege level is 3.
  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used but the destination is not a memory operand.

## Operation

```C
DEST := NOT DEST;
```
