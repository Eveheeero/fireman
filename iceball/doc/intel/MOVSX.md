# MOVSX/MOVSXD

Move With Sign-Extension

Copies the contents of the source operand (register or memory location) to the destination operand (register) and Â® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Devel-sign extends the value to 16 or 32 bits (see Figure 7-6 in the Inteloper's Manual, Volume 1).
The size of the converted value depends on the operand-size attribute.In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits.
Use of the REX.R prefix permits access to addi-tional registers (R8-R15).
Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits.
See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.
