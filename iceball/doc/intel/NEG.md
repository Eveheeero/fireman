# NEG

Two's Complement Negation

Replaces the value of operand (the destination operand) with its two's complement.
(This operation is equivalent to subtracting the operand from 0.) The destination operand is located in a general-purpose register or a memory location.This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits.
Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15).
Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits.
See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.

## Flags affected

- The CF flag set to 0 if the source operand is 0; otherwise it is set to 1. The OF, SF, ZF, AF, and PF flags are set according to the result. 

## Exceptions

- Real-Address Mode Exceptions
  - #GP - If a memory operand effective address is ou
  > tside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  - #SS - If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS segment limit.
  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used but the destination is not a memory operand.
- Protected Mode Exceptions
  - #GP(0) - If the destination is located in a non-writable segment.
  > If a memory operand effective address is outs
  > ide the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  > If the DS, ES, FS, or GS register contains a NULL segment selector.
  - #SS(0) - If a memory operand effective a
  > ddress is outside the SS segment limit.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled and an
  > unaligned memory reference is made while the 
  > current privilege level is 3.
- 64-Bit Mode Exceptions
  - #SS(0) - If a memory address referencing the SS segment is in a non-canonical form.
  - #GP(0) - If the memory address is in a non-canonical form.
  - #PF(fault-code) - For a page fault.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled and an
  > unaligned memory reference is made while the 
- Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions
  - #GP(0) - If a memory operand effective address is
  > outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  - #SS(0) - If a memory operand effective ad
  > dress is outside the SS segment limit.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled an
  > d an unaligned memory reference is made.
  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used but the destination is not a memory operand.
- Compatibility Mode Exceptions
  > Same as for protected mode exceptions.

## Operation

```C
IF DEST = 0 THEN CF := 0;ELSE CF := 1; FI;DEST := [- (DEST)]
```
