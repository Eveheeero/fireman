# XRSTOR

Restore Processor Extended States

Performs a full or partial restore of processor state components from the XSAVE area located at the memory address specified by the source operand.
The implicit EDX:EAX register pair specifies a 64-bit instruction mask.
The specific state components restored correspond to the bits set in the requested-feature bitmap (RFBM), which is the logical-AND of EDX:EAX and XCR0.速 64 and IA-32 Architectures Soft-The format of the XSAVE area is detailed in Section 13.4, "XSAVE Area," of Intelware Developer's Manual, Volume 1.
Like FXRSTOR and FXSAVE, the memory format used for x87 state depends 速 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's on a REX.W prefix; see Section 13.5.1, "x87 State" of IntelManual, Volume 1.速Section 13.8, "Operation of XRSTOR," of Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1 provides a detailed description of the operation of the XRSTOR instruction.
The following items provide a high-level outline: - Execution of XRSTOR may take one of two forms: standard and compacted.
Bit63 of the XCOMP_BV field in the XSAVE header determines which form is used: value 0 specifies the standard form, while value 1 specifies the compacted form.
- 1If RFBM[i]= 0, XRSTOR does not update state component i.
- If RFBM[i]= 1 and biti is clear in the XSTATE_BV field in the XSAVE header, XRSTOR initializes state component i.
- If RFBM[i]= 1 and XSTATE_BV[i]= 1, XRSTOR loads state componenti from the XSAVE area.
- The standard form of XRSTOR treats MXCSR (which is part of state component 1 - SSE) differently from the XMM registers.
If either form attempts to load MXCSR with an illegal value, a general-protection exception (#GP) occurs.
- XRSTOR loads the internal value XRSTOR_INFO, which may be used to optimize a subsequent execution of XSAVEOPT or XSAVES.
- Immediately following an execution of XRSTOR, the processor tracks as in-use (not in initial configuration) any state componenti for which RFBM[i]= 1 and XSTATE_BV[i]= 1; it tracks as modified any state component ifor which RFBM[i]= 0.Use of a source operand not aligned to 64-byte boundary (for 64-bit and 32-bit modes) results in a general-protec-tion (#GP) exception.
In 64-bit mode, the upper 32 bits of RDX and RAX are ignored.速 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software See Section 13.6, "Processor Tracking of XSAVE-Managed State," of IntelDeveloper's Manual, Volume 1 for discussion of the bitmaps XINUSE and XMODIFIED and of the quantity XRSTOR_INFO.
