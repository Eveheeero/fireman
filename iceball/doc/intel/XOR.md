# XOR

Logical Exclusive OR

Performs a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation on the destination (first) and source (second) operands and stores the result in the destination operand location.
The source operand can be an immediate, a register, or a memory location; the destination operand can be a register or a memory location.
(However, two memory oper-ands cannot be used in one instruction.) Each bit of the result is 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different; each bit is 0 if the corresponding bits are the same.In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15).
Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits.
See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.

## Flags affected

- The OF and CF flags are cleared; the SF, ZF, and PF flags are set according to the result. The state of the AF flag is undefined.

## Exceptions

- 64-Bit Mode Exceptions
  - #SS(0) - If a memory address referencing the SS segment is in a non-canonical form.
  - #GP(0) - If the memory address is in a non-canonical form.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled and an
  > unaligned memory reference is made while the 
  > current privilege level is 3.
- Real-Address Mode Exceptions
  - #GP - If a memory operand effective address is ou
  > tside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  - #SS - If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS segment limit.
  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used but th
  > e destination is not a memory operand.
- Compatibility Mode Exceptions
  > Same exceptions as in protected mode.
- Protected Mode Exceptions
  - #GP(0) - If the destination operand points to a non-writable segment.
  > If a memory operand effective address is outs
  > ide the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  > If the DS, ES, FS, or GS register contains a NULL segment selector.
  - #SS(0) - If a memory operand effective a
  > ddress is outside the SS segment limit.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled and an
  > unaligned memory reference is made while the 
  > current privilege level is 3.
  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used but th
  > e destination is not a memory operand.
- Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions
  - #GP(0) - If a memory operand effective address is
  > outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  - #SS(0) - If a memory operand effective a
  > ddress is outside the SS segment limit.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled an
  > d an unaligned memory reference is made.
  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used but th
  > e destination is not a memory operand.

## Operation

```C
DEST := DEST XOR SRC;
```
