# CMP

Compare Two Operands

Compares the first source operand with the second source operand and sets the status flags in the EFLAGS register according to the results.
The comparison is performed by subtracting the second operand from the first operand and then setting the status flags in the same manner as the SUB instruction.
When an immediate value is used as an operand, it is sign-extended to the length of the first operand.The condition codes used by the Jcc, CMOVcc, and SETcc instructions are based on the results of a CMP instruction.
Â® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Appendix B, "EFLAGS ConditIn 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits.
Use of the REX.R prefix permits access to addi-tional registers (R8-R15).
Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits.
See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.

## Flags affected

- The CF, OF, SF, ZF, AF, and PF flags are set according to the result.

## Exceptions

- Real-Address Mode Exceptions
  - #GP - If a memory operand effective address is ou

  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used.
- Protected Mode Exceptions
  - #GP(0) - If a memory operand effective address is

## Operation

```C
temp := SRC1 - SignExtend(SRC2); ModifyStatusFlags; (* Modify status flags in the same manner as the SUB instruction*)
