# XCHG

Exchange Register/Memory With Register

Exchanges the contents of the destination (first) and source (second) operands.
The operands can be two general-purpose registers or a register and a memory location.
If a memory operand is referenced, the processor's locking protocol is automatically implemented for the duration of the exchange operation, regardless of the presence or absence of the LOCK prefix or of the value of the IOPL.
(See the LOCK prefix description in this chapter for more information on the locking protocol.)This instruction is useful for implementing semaphores or similar data structures for process synchronization.
(See Â® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3A, for "Bus Locking" in Chapter 9 of the Intelmore information on bus locking.) The XCHG instruction can also be used instead of the BSWAP instruction for 16-bit operands.In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits.
Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15).
Using a REX prefix NOTEXCHG (E)AX, (E)AX (encoded instruction byte is 90H) is an alias for NOP regardless of data size prefixes, including REX.W.

## Flags affected

- None.

## Exceptions

- Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions
  - #GP(0) - If a memory operand effective address is
  > outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  - #SS(0) - If a memory operand effective a
  > ddress is outside the SS segment limit.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled an
  > d an unaligned memory reference is made.
  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used but th
  > e destination is not a memory operand.
- Protected Mode Exceptions
  - #GP(0) - If either operand is in a non-writable segment.
  > If a memory operand effective address is outs
  > ide the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  > If the DS, ES, FS, or GS register contains a NULL segment selector.
  - #SS(0) - If a memory operand effective a
  > ddress is outside the SS segment limit.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled and an
  > unaligned memory reference is made while the 
  > current privilege level is 3.
  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used but th
  > e destination is not a memory operand.
- Compatibility Mode Exceptions
  > Same exceptions as in protected mode.
- 64-Bit Mode Exceptions
  - #SS(0) - If a memory address referencing the SS segment is in a non-canonical form.
  - #GP(0) - If the memory address is in a non-canonical form.
  - #PF(fault-code) - If a page fault occurs.
  - #AC(0) - If alignment checking is enabled and an
  > unaligned memory reference is made while the 
  > current privilege level is 3.
- Real-Address Mode Exceptions
  - #GP - If a memory operand effective address is ou
  > tside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
  - #SS - If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS segment limit.
  - #UD - If the LOCK prefix is used but th
  > e destination is not a memory operand.

## Operation

TEMP := DEST;DEST := SRC;SRC := TEMP;
```
