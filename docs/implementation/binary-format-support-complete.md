# Binary Format Support Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented basic support for multiple binary formats in the Fireman decompiler:

### 1. Binary Namespace Refactoring

- Consolidated PE, ELF, and Mach-O modules under `binary` namespace
- Improved modularity and organization
- Updated all imports to use the new structure

### 2. ELF Format Support

- Implemented ELF parser for 64-bit binaries
- Added header parsing with endianness support
- Implemented program header and section header parsing
- Created Fire and FireRaw trait implementations
- Added comprehensive tests for ELF format detection

### 3. Mach-O Format Support

- Implemented Mach-O parser for 64-bit binaries
- Added support for both little-endian and big-endian formats
- Created Fire and FireRaw trait implementations
- Added tests for architecture detection and format parsing

### 4. Architecture Detection

- Implemented binary format auto-detection based on magic bytes
- Support for detecting:
    - PE (Windows) - MZ header
    - ELF (Linux/Unix) - 0x7F ELF
    - Mach-O (macOS) - Various magic numbers for 32/64-bit and endianness

### 5. Test Coverage

- Created `elf_parser_test.rs` with 4 passing tests
- Created `macho_parser_test.rs` with 4 passing tests
- All tests verify format detection, architecture detection, and basic parsing

## Implementation Details

### ELF Parser (`binary/elf/`)

```rust
- parser.rs: Handles ELF parsing with endianness support
- header.rs: ELF header structures and constants
- section.rs: Section header definitions
- symbol.rs: Symbol table structures
- fire.rs: Fire and FireRaw trait implementations
```

### Mach-O Parser (`binary/macho/`)

```rust
- parser.rs: Handles Mach-O parsing with endianness support
- header.rs: Mach-O header structures and magic numbers
- segment.rs: Segment and section definitions
- symbol.rs: Symbol table structures
- fire.rs: Fire and FireRaw trait implementations
```

### Common Binary Operations (`binary/mod.rs`)

- Architecture detection functions
- Endianness detection
- 64-bit format detection

## Current Limitations

1. **32-bit Support**: Both ELF and Mach-O parsers currently only support 64-bit formats
2. **Load Commands**: Mach-O load commands are not fully parsed
3. **Symbol Tables**: Symbol table parsing is stubbed out for both formats
4. **Analysis Functions**: The actual disassembly and analysis functions return "not implemented" errors

## Next Steps

1. Implement actual disassembly for ELF and Mach-O formats
2. Add 32-bit binary support
3. Parse symbol tables for better function/variable resolution
4. Implement load command parsing for Mach-O
5. Add support for dynamic libraries and relocations

## Testing

All parsers have been tested with minimal valid headers and pass format detection tests:

```bash
cargo test elf_parser_test     # 4 tests pass
cargo test macho_parser_test   # 4 tests pass
```

The binary format support infrastructure is now in place and ready for further development.
