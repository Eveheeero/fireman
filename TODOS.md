### 🎨 Enhanced C Generation Pipeline

```
Binary → Disassembly → Low IR → Medium IR → High IR → Enhanced C
                           ↓         ↓          ↓         ↓
                    [Deterministic] [Patterns] [Types] [Modern]
```

**Current Status**:

- ✅ Binary → Low IR: Working
- ✅ Low IR → Medium IR: Working

  - Fixed-width types (uint32_t, int64_t)
  - nullptr instead of NULL
  - Range-based for loops

### 🔧 Systematic Implementation Approach

**📚 Implementation Guides Created:**

- [`docs/implementation/c-generation-fixes.md`](docs/implementation/c-generation-fixes.md) - Complete fix guide
- [`docs/implementation/immediate-fixes-spec.md`](docs/implementation/immediate-fixes-spec.md) - Technical specification
- [`docs/implementation/execution-plan.md`](docs/implementation/execution-plan.md) - Week-by-week plan

#### Phase 1: Fix Core C Generation (Current Week)

```rust
// Critical Issues (2 bugs blocking everything):
1. Missing return statements - Pattern::LowIR lacks terminator info
2. Bad variable names - "param_0", "result_0" instead of meaningful names

// Root Cause:
Pattern::LowIR { instructions, confidence } // Missing terminator!
convert_low_ir_instructions() // Only processes instructions, not terminators

// Solution (2-day fix):
Day 1: Add terminator to Pattern, handle in High IR
Day 2: Fix variable naming using LocalId::purpose
Day 3: Test and verify all outputs compile
```

#### Phase 2: Smart Variable Naming

```rust
// Naming Strategy:
1. Parameters: Use function signature hints
2. Locals: Extract from LocalId purpose field
3. Temporaries: Context-based naming (loop_counter, condition, etc.)
4. Globals: Preserve original symbols when available

// Implementation:
- Create NameResolver trait
- Implement semantic analysis for common patterns
- Add name propagation through IR transformations
```

#### Phase 3: Pattern Enhancement

```rust
// Pattern Priority:
1. Array access: ptr + offset patterns
2. Struct access: base + field offset
3. Function pointers: indirect call patterns
4. String operations: strlen, strcpy patterns

// Database Design:
- YAML/JSON pattern definitions
- Confidence scoring per pattern
- Version control for pattern evolution
```

## 🏛️ Architecture-Specific Considerations [NEW SECTION]

### x86/x86_64 Unified Handling

- **Shared Components**:
    - Common instruction decoding logic
    - Unified memory addressing modes
    - Shared flag handling
- **Differences to Handle**:
    - Register sizes (32 vs 64-bit)
    - Default operand sizes
    - REX prefix handling (x86_64 only)
    - Calling conventions (cdecl/stdcall vs System V/Win64)

### ARM32/ARM64 Unified Handling

- **Shared Components**:
    - Condition code system
    - Load/store architecture principles
    - Similar instruction patterns
- **Differences to Handle**:
    - Register count (R0-R15 vs X0-X30)
    - Instruction encoding (32-bit vs fixed 32-bit)
    - Thumb mode (ARM32 only)
    - SIMD differences (NEON vs SVE)

### Cross-Architecture Patterns

- **Common Patterns**:
  ```rust
  // Function prologue detection
  match arch {
      X86 | X86_64 => detect_x86_prologue(),
      ARM32 | ARM64 => detect_arm_prologue(),
  }

  // Calling convention mapping
  let arg_regs = match (arch, platform) {
      (X86_64, Linux) => &["rdi", "rsi", "rdx", "rcx", "r8", "r9"],
      (X86_64, Windows) => &["rcx", "rdx", "r8", "r9"],
      (ARM64, _) => &["x0", "x1", "x2", "x3", "x4", "x5", "x6", "x7"],
      _ => &[],
  };
  ```

### AST Generation Strategy

- **Architecture-Aware Types**:
    - size_t → uint32_t or uint64_t based on arch
    - intptr_t → proper sized integer
    - Pointer sizes in struct layouts
- **Numeric Display**:
    - Addresses: Always hex with proper width (8 or 16 digits)
    - Small constants: Decimal by default
    - Bit patterns: Hex or binary based on context
    - User override: Global format preference
